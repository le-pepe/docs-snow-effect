**Snow Effect** is a simple snow effect that can be added to any website. It is a lightweight and customizable plugin that can be easily integrated into your website. The snow effect is created using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The plugin is easy to use and can be customized to suit your needs.

## Quick Start
### Installation
To install as a module, you can use npm, pnpm, or yarn.
<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install snow-effect --save
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install snow-effect
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add snow-effect
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or you can use the CDN link in your HTML file.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/snow-effect"></script>
```
We also have a Nuxt module available for easy integration.
```bash
// npm
npm install nuxt-snow-effect --save
// pnpm
pnpm install nuxt-snow-effect
// yarn
yarn add nuxt-snow-effect
// or nuxi
npx nuxi module add nuxt-snow-effect
```
